## Local repo, forked from some cool papers and combining code from both

# Inferring-Extinction-Year-using-a-Bayesian-Approach

and
# Inferring extinction date of a species using non-homogeneous Poisson processes with a change-point

The code uses utility programs from a book which  has the following citation:

 John K. Kruschke's Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R and BUGS (1e) / A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan
